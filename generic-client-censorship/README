----------------------
Creating a new package
----------------------

1) set up a new mercurial repo based on
    projects/generic-client-package
    - `cd ..; hg clone generic-client-package REPO_NAME`
    - edit the 'default-push' entry in REPO_NAME/.hg/hgrc 
        to point to your new remote repository

2) change the package name to your package name
    - `hg mv package PACKAGE_NAME`

3) update the setup.py script:
    - change 'package' to PACKAGE_NAME
    - uncomment and set values for the author fields
    - list any package dependencies in the
        'install_requires' list

--------------------
Testing your package
--------------------

1) check out projects/generic-client-bootstrap

2) add PACKAGE_NAME to the end of the "packages"
    line in bootstrap.cfg

3) create a symlink to PACKAGE_NAME in this repo
    in generic-client-bootstrap/packages

4) in generic-client-bootstrap, run `python shim.py`

----------------------
Deploying your package
----------------------

1) increment the __version__ variable in YOUR_PACKAGE.__version__

2) create symlinks in the root of this repo to any
    dependencies (e.g. projects/generic-client-nethelper)

3) build the .egg distribution
    - `python setup.py`

4) publish the .egg file
    - `scp dist/[PACKAGE_NAME]-[VERSION]-py2.X.egg aqualab:`
    - log in to aqualab@sidamo
    - `cd server-package-manager`
    - `python add.py --channel [RELEASE_CHANNEL] [--needs_init] \
            [--overwrite] ../[EGG_FILE]
        - RELEASE_CHANNEL should be one of {release, beta, alpha}
            and determines which clients will download this
            version of your package
        - set the "--needs_init" option if your package uses the
            'init' and 'shutdown' framework. This will usually be
            the case! The main exception is when you are developing
            a _library_ that does not need to be initialized, but
            is a listed dependency for another package.
        - set the "--overwrite" option if you have already deployed
            this version of the package. Note that some clients may
            have already downloaded an earlier .egg file and may not
            download this one! Better to increment the version and
            force a new download.
